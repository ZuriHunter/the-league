**The League** no relation to the actual TV Show, but it is one of my many side project ideas of combining family tradition with technology. It will probably will not be done any time soon but it is a way for me to exercise both my skills with Ruby On Rails and Javascript.

# History
Since I was able to formulate words my large family would get together on Sunday's to watch America's great past time....American Football. This was our way of connecting and growing together.  In the midst of these gatherings we would do lovely predictions on the set of teams that will win for the week. At the end of Monday Night Football whoever had the best record would win a special reward. This tradition grew to the point where my amazing Dad was writing web-scrappers on NFL's website to pull live score updates into a Excel spreadsheet and displayed it as we were watching the games. This was all great but it never went beyond Excel spreadsheets, in so through this side project my goal is to make this a web/mobile application.

# Prerequisites

# Getting Started
